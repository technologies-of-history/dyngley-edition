The linked repository contains the basic content for the site: the Introduction, About, Credit, and Resources pages. The data and metadata generated from the manuscript transcriptions and annotations are held in a separate GitHub repository, technologies-of-history/dyngley-data. The two repositories are linked to one another with EditionCrafter, a publication tool for digital critical editions under development by the Making and Knowing Project (M&amp;amp;K), Performant Software Solutions, and a number of case-study collaborators.</description></item><item><title>Credits</title><link>https://technologies-of-history.github.io/dyngley-edition/credits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://technologies-of-history.github.io/dyngley-edition/credits/</guid><description>Lead Editor Melissa Reynolds, Assistant Professor of History, Texas Christian University
