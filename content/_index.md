'Old Books, New Attitudes' is a student-centered initiative to transcribe and digitally reconstruct the medieval medical manuscript collection of a single early modern collector: the Elizabethan English gentleman Henry Dyngley. The edition available on this site is a work-in-progress, produced by students at Texas Christian University in subsequent semesters of "[Technologies of History from Cuneiform to Coding](https://technologies-of-history.github.io/spring-2026)," taught by [Dr. Melissa Reynolds](https://melissabreynolds.com). 

To learn more about Henry Dyngley and his manuscript collection, visit the [Introduction](./introduction.md) page. To read about student-centered transcription, digital history, and the digital platforms and tools involved in this project, visit the [About](./about.md) page. To read a partial transcription of one of Dyngley's manuscripts, Trinity College Cambridge MS O.8.35, visit the [Folios](./folios.md) page. 

Check back in Spring 2026 to see more progress and read up on student contributors on the [Credits](./credits.md) page!
